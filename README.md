**Claude's Buns 🍑** is a Bun runtime wrapper for the official `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` package. It lets you run Claude Code without needing Node.js installed - just Bun!

## Why Claude's Buns? 🍑

- **🚀 No Node.js Required**: Run Claude Code with only Bun installed
- **📦 Official Package**: Uses the official `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` package under the hood
- **⚡ Bun Performance**: Leverages Bun's fast JavaScript runtime and package management
- **🔄 Always Up-to-Date**: Automatically uses the latest official Claude Code version
- **💯 Full Compatibility**: All Claude Code features and commands work exactly as expected

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Bun (if you haven't already)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### 2. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-buns.git
cd claudes-buns
bun install
```

### 3. Run Claude Code via Bun
```bash
# Interactive mode
bun run claude

# Or use any Claude Code command
bun run claude --help
bun run claude -p "explain this code" 
bun run claude config
```

## What This Does

Claude's Buns 🍑 is a lightweight wrapper that:

1. **Downloads** the official `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` package
2. **Runs** it through Bun's Node.js compatibility layer
3. **Passes through** all commands, options, and functionality seamlessly

You get the **exact same Claude Code experience** but running on **Bun instead of Node.js**.

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Direct Bun Usage (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-buns.git
cd claudes-buns

# Install with Bun
bun install

# Use Claude Code
bun run claude
```

### Method 2: Build and Use Binary
```bash
# Build the wrapper
bun run build

# Run the built version
bun run start

# Or run directly
./dist/index.js --help
```

### Method 3: Docker (Distroless) 🐳
Perfect for CI/CD, containerized environments, or when you want zero dependencies:

```bash
# Build the distroless image
docker build -t claudes-buns:latest .

# Run Claude Code in container
docker run -it --rm claudes-buns:latest

# Interactive session with volume mount
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/workspace -w /workspace claudes-buns:latest

# Use as base image in your Dockerfile
FROM claudes-buns:latest
# Your app code here...
```

#### Docker Image Features:
- **🔒 Distroless**: No OS, no package manager, no shell - maximum security
- **📦 Tiny Size**: ~50MB total (Bun + Claude Code + minimal runtime)
- **⚡ Fast**: Multi-stage build with optimized layers
- **🛡️ Secure**: Non-root user, minimal attack surface
- **🚀 Ready**: Pre-built with all Claude Code dependencies

## Available Commands

All official Claude Code commands work through Claude's Buns 🍑:

```bash
# Start interactive session
bun run claude

# Print mode for scripting
bun run claude -p "help me debug this function"

# Configuration
bun run claude config set theme dark
bun run claude config get

# MCP server management
bun run claude mcp

# Resume conversations
bun run claude -r

# Continue last conversation
bun run claude -c

# Version and help
bun run claude --version
bun run claude --help
```

## Benefits Over Original

| Feature | Node.js + Claude Code | Bun + Claude's Buns 🍑 |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Runtime Dependency** | Node.js + npm | Just Bun |
| **Installation Time** | Slower (npm install) | Faster (bun install) |
| **Startup Time** | Standard Node.js | Faster Bun runtime |
| **Package Management** | npm/yarn/pnpm | Bun (built-in) |
| **Docker Support** | ❌ No official image | ✅ Distroless image |
| **Container Size** | ~200MB+ (with Node.js) | ~50MB (distroless) |
| **Security** | Full OS in container | Minimal attack surface |
| **Features** | ✅ Full | ✅ Full (identical) |
| **Updates** | Manual npm update | Automatic with bun install |

## How It Works

```
User Command → Claude's Buns 🍑 Wrapper → Official Claude Code → Claude AI
     ↓              ↓                         ↓                  ↓
bun run claude → src/index.ts → @anthropic-ai/claude-code → Anthropic API
```

Claude's Buns 🍑 simply:
1. Receives your command
2. Spawns the official Claude Code CLI using `bun run`
3. Passes through all input/output seamlessly
4. Handles graceful shutdown and error reporting

## Requirements

### Local Development
- **Bun** 1.0+ (the only requirement!)
- **Internet connection** (for downloading Claude Code package and AI requests)

### Docker (Distroless)
- **Docker** (no other dependencies needed!)
- **Internet connection** (for AI requests)

## Troubleshooting

### "bun: command not found"
Install Bun first:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"
export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
```

### "Cannot find module @anthropic-ai/claude-code"
Run the install command:
```bash
bun install
```

### Authentication Issues
Claude's Buns 🍑 uses the same authentication as official Claude Code. Follow the official Claude Code authentication setup.

### Docker Issues
If you encounter Docker-related issues:

```bash
# Test the build
docker build -t claudes-buns:test .

# Run with debugging
docker run -it --rm claudes-buns:test --version
```

## Docker Usage Examples

### Use as Base Image
```dockerfile
# Your project's Dockerfile - multi-stage build
FROM claudes-buns:latest as claude-base

# Your application stage
FROM node:alpine as app-build
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install && npm run build

# Final stage - distroless with Claude + your app
FROM gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11:nonroot
COPY --from=claude-base /usr/local/bin/bun /usr/local/bin/bun
COPY --from=claude-base /app /claude
COPY --from=app-build /app/dist /workspace
WORKDIR /workspace
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/bun", "run", "/claude/dist/index.js", "-p", "review this code"]
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```dockerfile
# Single multi-stage build for CI
FROM claudes-buns:latest as claude
FROM alpine:latest as runner
RUN apk add --no-cache ca-certificates
COPY --from=claude /usr/local/bin/bun /usr/local/bin/bun
COPY --from=claude /app /claude
COPY . /workspace
WORKDIR /workspace  
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/bun", "run", "/claude/dist/index.js"]
```

## 🚀 Raspberry Pi Zero Support

Claude's Buns 🍑 includes special support for Raspberry Pi Zero deployment:

### Quick Pi Zero Setup
```bash
# On your computer - create deployment package
./create-pi-package.sh

# Transfer to Pi Zero  
scp claude-buns-pi-zero.tar.gz pi@raspberrypi.local:~

# On Pi Zero - deploy and run
tar xzf claude-buns-pi-zero.tar.gz
cd claude-buns-pi  
./deploy-pi-zero.sh
bun run claude --help
```

**Pi Zero Performance**: Expect 3-5 second boot times (vs 1.1s on desktop)

## 🐳 Docker Support

Multi-stage Alpine build for containerized environments:

```bash
# Build distroless image (~227MB)
docker build -t claudes-buns .

# Run with volume mount for file operations
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/workspace -w /workspace claudes-buns

# Use as base image in your projects
FROM claudes-buns:latest
COPY . /workspace
WORKDIR /workspace
CMD ["bun", "run", "dist/index.js", "-p", "review this code"]
```
